## Sections

Sections are ment as mathod of definig very high-level options, that may be very opinionated and thus not suited for everybody.

Sections can be enabled individually. They can be definied by third parties, so to circumvent name collisions all sections defined by this repository are prefixed with `stock-`. Please do not use this prefix for any sections defined by other repositories, though it might be advised you pick your own prefix.
