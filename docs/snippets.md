# Snippets

Snippets are meant as method of definig very high-level options, that may be very opinionated and thus not suited for everybody.

Snippets can be enabled individually. They can be definied by third parties, so to circumvent name collisions all snippets defined by this repository are prefixed with `stock-`. Please do not use this prefix for any snippets defined by other repositories, though it might be advised you pick your own prefix.
